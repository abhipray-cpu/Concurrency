Hello, World!
This is a sample text file.
It contains multiple lines of text,
each of which can be processed concurrently.
The goal is to demonstrate how to handle
file I/O operations in Go using concurrency.
This approach can significantly improve performance
when dealing with large files or when performing
complex processing on each line of text.
Remember, Go makes concurrency intuitive and efficient,
leveraging goroutines and channels.
Enjoy exploring concurrent programming in Go!
