# Concurrent File Search Application Project Layout

This project is structured to facilitate development, testing, and deployment of a concurrent file search application in Go.

## Project Structure

- `/cmd`
  - `/searchapp`
    - `main.go` - The entry point of the application, handling command-line arguments and starting the search process.
- `/pkg`
  - `/search`
    - `search.go` - Contains the core search logic, including file traversal and pattern matching.
    - `worker.go` - Defines the worker pool for concurrent searches.
  - `/utils`
    - `utils.go` - Utility functions, such as error handling and result formatting.
- `/test`
  - `/search`
    - `search_test.go` - Unit tests for search functionality.
  - `/utils`
    - `utils_test.go` - Unit tests for utility functions.
- `/docs`
  - `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation on the project, including setup, usage, and deployment instructions.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- `/scripts`
  - `setup.sh` - Script for setting up any necessary environment for the application.
  - `run_tests.sh` - Script to run all unit tests and report any failures.

## Key Components

- **Main Application (`/cmd/searchapp/main.go`)**: Parses command-line arguments and kicks off the search process.
- **Search Logic (`/pkg/search/search.go`)**: Implements the logic for traversing directories and searching files for the specified pattern.
- **Worker Pool (`/pkg/search/worker.go`)**: Manages a pool of workers to perform file searches concurrently.
- **Utility Functions (`/pkg/utils/utils.go`)**: Provides common utility functions used across the application.
- **Tests (`/test`)**: Contains unit tests for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application's functionality.
- **Documentation (`/docs`)**: Offers detailed information about the project for users and contributors.
- **Scripts (`/scripts`)**: Includes utility scripts for project setup and testing.

## Testing

Unit tests are organized parallel to their corresponding code within the `/test` directory. Tests can be run individually or collectively using a script for continuous integration purposes.

## Documentation

The `/docs` directory contains all necessary documentation to understand, use, and contribute to the project. This includes a detailed `README.md` for users and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` for potential contributors.

## Scripts

Utility scripts in the `/scripts` directory facilitate common tasks such as setting up the development environment and running tests, making it easier to maintain and contribute to the project.
